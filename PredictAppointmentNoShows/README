The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict which patients are likely to miss their
appointments, using the provided dataset. The dataset contains 14 variables that could potentially be used as features,
as well as a binary label (patient showed up to appointment, patient didn’t show up to appointment). The feature
names are largely self-explanatory and include: age; gender; time between the date the appointment was made and
the date of the actual appointment; whether the patient is diabetic, hypertensive, a smoker, or an alcoholic; and
whether they were reminded via text message about the appointment.

This is an example of a practical application of machine learning: a medical oce may be interested in identifying
which patients are most likely to not show up to their appointments and take extra steps for these patients to ensure
their arrival.

We will predict the probability of No-shows (label=1).
